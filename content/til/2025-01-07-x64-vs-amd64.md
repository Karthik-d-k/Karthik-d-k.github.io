- On GitHub, when I download binaries for my WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), I found that people use x86_64 and amd64 interchangeably to refer to the same thing, which is a processor that implements the 64-bit version of the x86 (32-bit ISA).
- There are many 32-bit and 64-bit Instruction Set Architectures (ISA) available, which are implemented by processors.
- x86 is the 32-bit ISA, whereas x86_64 is the general name used by most people to refer to the 64-bit version of x86.
- However, AMD was the company that released the 64-bit version of x86, and they named it amd64.
- There are many historical reasons for using two different names, **x86_64** and **amd64**, to refer to the same 64-bit ISA of x86 (32-bit ISA), but the important thing to remember is that **both refers to same thing**.
