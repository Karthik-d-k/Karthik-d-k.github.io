Often, we deal with bitwise operations to manipulate data at the bit level.\nOne of the common challenges that arise in such scenarios is endianness - the order in which bytes are arranged within larger data types.\nOnly if we know how the data is stored, we can correctly interpret and manipulate it.\nEndianness\nEndianness defines how multi-byte data will be stored in our computer memory.\nBig-endian and Little-endian are the types widely used; other types may not be relevant to most users.\nexplore wiki for this.\n\nSmallest addressable unit of data in current computing systems is byte (8-bits).\n\nEndianness comes into the picture when we try to read/write multi-byte data. Endianness does not matter if you have a single byte.\n\n\nBig-endian: When we store multi-byte data, the most-significant byte will be stored at the lowest addressed memory.\n\n\nLittle-endian: When we store multi-byte data, the least-significant byte will be stored at the lowest addressed memory.\n\n\nWe can visualize this difference by running the following c code snippet.\nSnippet 1:\n\nSnippet 1 stdout:\n\n\nLet’s assume our 16-bit data is 0x1122 wherein 0x11 is the most-significant byte and 0x22 is the least-significant byte.\nHere, I’m using htobe16 and htole16 functions from endian.h to simulate big- and little-endian representations. Note: endian.h is GNU-specific; on other platforms you may use htons/ntohs or manual byte operations.\nBy reading the first byte stored at the lowest address of our data, we get to know that a LE machine stores the least-significant byte and a BE machine stores the most-significant byte.\n\nUsing the above example with slight modification, we could get to know our machine’s endianness.\nSnippet 2:\n\nSnippet 2 stdout:\n\nBit Twiddling\nI will explain how to set/clear the bits in a multi-byte data by taking endianness into account.\nLet’s say we have a 32-bit data and we had to set the 25th bit and clear the 6th bit, the usual way is to\nuse a bit-mask and do bit-wise operations as shown in the below snippet:\nSnippet 3:\n\nSnippet 3 stdout:\n\n\nFrom the above snippet, we can confirm that endianness comes into the picture only when we treat multibyte data as raw bytes, but doesn’t matter when we operate using multi-byte operations directly.\n\nReal world scenarios\nRaw memory dumps\nWhen we get memory dumps from GDB, QEMU, EEPROM and/or flash images, we should know beforehand which endian is used to store the data.\nSnippet 4:\n\nFrom the above snippet, we can confirm that if we had to read 32-bit data from the raw memory dump, we could end up with different values if we don’t know how it was stored in the first place.\nELF\nExecutable and Linkable Format (ELF) is a common file format for executables, object files, shared libraries, device drivers and core dumps.\nThe fifth byte of the ELF header (e_ident[EI_DATA]) determines how to interpret all subsequent multi-byte fields (such as addresses, offsets, and sizes) in the entire file.\n\nValue 1: Specifies Little-endian encoding\nValue 2: Specifies Big-endian encoding\n\nNetwork protocols\nMost networking protocols use network byte order which is big-endian, but be careful out there because some network protocols use little-endian too.\nKerberos\nVersion 2 of Keytab file format always uses big-endian byte order, whereas\nversion 1 uses native byte order for integer representations.\nBinary file formats\nMany binary file formats either encode the endian type or use a fixed endian type for that particular file format.\nSo we have to consider this if we are dealing with raw binary formats in any form.\nConclusion\n\nFull script is available on github endianness_fiasco.c\n\n","description":"","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/endianness-fiasco/","path":"/blog/endianness-fiasco/","title":"Endianness Fiasco"},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/hubris-on-pico2-riscv/":{"body":"Overview\nIf you haven’t checked it out already, go through my hubris-on-pico2 blog post where I explained how to get the Hubris OS running on the RP Pico 2W board’s Cortex-M33 core. I have also explained the technical details of the tools that I used for development.\nIn this blog post, I will explain how I got the same Hubris OS running on the RP Pico 2W board’s Hazard3 RISC-V core.\nIf you want to follow along, please refer to the exhubris-riscv-hazard3 repo for the working code.\nRISC-V kernel\nBuilding tasks is the same as what I have done on the ARM core, but for the kernel, I have used my RISC-V port present in the hubris-riscv-hazard3 repo.\nFor technical details about the RISC-V port, please refer to this discussion. I have made changes based on jperkin's implementation and updated/changed code to support the latest Hubris version. I have added some logs on top of it and did a few Pico 2 board specific changes.\nBuilding and Flashing\nNow, I will talk about how we could compile and build the firmware and flash it onto the Pico 2W board.\nI’m using just to simplify the build process. Follow the repo for installing the tool.\n\n\nBuilding and flashing the application\nIn the first terminal:\n\nOutput:\n\n\nThis will build the kernel and application using hubake and flash using openocd and wait for GDB to connect and run the app.\n\n\n\nRunning using GDB\nIn the second terminal:\n\nOutput:\n\n\nThis will load the kernel and application ELF files and wait for us to start the kernel.\n\n\n\nRunning the kernel\nIn GDB, you can start the kernel by setting the PC register to the kernel’s entry point and running continue:\n2nd terminal:\n\n1st terminal:\n\n\nAs you can see, the kernel launches successfully and schedules the 1st task supervisor which in turn schedules the next priority task blinky, which blinks an external LED.\nRefer to the hubris-riscv-hazard3 repo for complete details about the logs.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nIssues\nSysCall issue\nIn the supervisor task, I’m actually calling the sys_recv_notification syscall.\nThis syscall takes a notification mask as an input and listens only for notifications, leaving messages queued.\nWe use value 1 as our notification mask; this is a fixed detail of the kernel-supervisor interface: the kernel pokes bit 0 on fault.\nI forgot to implement this syscall initially for RISC-V and I faced the below issue:\n\nOpenOCD output:\n\n\n\nJust after flashing the kernel and trying to run it, OpenOCD reported a hart reset. There wasn’t any additional info as to what could be the reason for this because the kernel hadn’t even started to run to get the logs. After many trial and errors and studying the ARM userlib source code, I got to know I’m depending on this syscall. After implementing the syscall, the issue was resolved.\n\nPico hardware issue\nThis issue caused me sleepless nights and it took me around 2 weeks to work around this issue 😢.\nAfter the kernel launches successfully and starts the supervisor task, this task then schedules the next priority task which is blinky in this case. During the execution of this task, I was facing the LoadFault Exception whenever the task tried to access PADS_BANK0 registers.\nSee below:\n\n\nAs you can see above, we hit UserEnvCall Exception which is a result of the supervisor task calling a syscall from userspace, and then when we switch to our next task blinky, we hit LoadFault Exception (MCAUSE: [0x00000005]), with PC pointing to 0x1000035e.\n\nI checked the disassembly and it was indeed a load instruction accessing the PADS_BANK0 memory region.\nCreating disassembly:\n\nBlinky task disassembly:\n\n\nReferring to the above assembly code, we are trying to access GPIO22 of the PADS_BANK0 register.\n\n\nAfter knowing what the issue was, I tried the following solutions:\n\n\nI first suspected this could be due to wrong PMP implementation, but after reviewing the PMP configuration, it seemed to be correct. I even changed the PMP implementation to match the tock-os implementation to make sure this was not the issue.\n\n\nI also checked the memory region permissions and ensured that the PADS_BANK0 region was correctly marked as accessible for the blinky task.\n\n\n\nI even tried to give full peripheral permissions to the blinky task as follows:\n\n\n\nI even tried not setting any explicit peripheral permissions for the blinky task, relying on the default permissions instead. Default permissions are set by Hardwired PMP Regions as follows:\n\nROM: 0x00000000 through 0x0fffffff\nPeripherals: 0x40000000 through 0x5fffffff\nSIO: 0xd0000000 through 0xdfffffff\n\n\n\n\nAll the above 4 solutions didn’t solve the issue, but in reality every one of these should have solved the problem.\n\nAfter many trial and errors, I gave up for a few days and started fresh and looked into the datasheet pretty closely. Then I found the important errata which is relevant to me.\nRP2350 Datasheet:\n\n\nAccording to the above errata, the issue seems to be only on QFN-60 package which is our Pico 2(W) boards. And also only PADS_BANK0 is affected, not Bank1.\n\nAs per the workaround, we have to implement a syscall to set the PADS register in kernel mode and then other things in user mode as earlier.\n\nI was not confident and comfortable enough to implement the syscall and check if this solves the issue. So I decided to set the registers before starting the Hubris kernel itself, which runs in M-mode, and once Hubris starts and schedules tasks, it automatically switches to U-mode wherein I toggle the GPIO which doesn’t involve touching the PADS registers.\n\n\nThis solved the issue and the blinky application works fine on RISC-V too 🥳.\n\nReferences\n\nRP2350 Datasheet\nCliffle’s Hubris Blog posts\nHubris Reference\nexhubris-demo-rp235x\nHubris-fork\nexhubris-fork\n\n","description":"","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/hubris-on-pico2-riscv/","path":"/blog/hubris-on-pico2-riscv/","title":"Hubris OS on RP Pico 2(W) board (Hazard3 RISC-V core)"},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/hubris-on-pico2/":{"body":"Motivation\nAs explained in my rp235x-blinky blog post, I have been experimenting with Hubris OS to port it to a RISC-V chip.\nI have access to a Pico 2W board for development and testing. This board is especially exciting because it comes with dual Cortex-M33 cores and dual RISC-V Hazard3 cores.\nMy approach was to start with the Cortex-M33 side first, since Hubris already has solid ARM support.\nIn this blog, I will explain how I got Hubris running on the ARM core Cortex-M33 of the Pico 2W board. I will also share my experience and challenges faced during the process.\nTechnical Details\nSetting up tools\nBefore I begin to explain how I got Hubris working on the Pico 2W board, I will explain the tools that I used for development. This part is where I spent most of my time\ninstalling the correct tools to work with Hubris. My development machine is Windows, so the details below are specific to Windows OS, but should be easier for Linux as well.\nI will list everything that we need to work with both ARM and RISC-V cores.\n\nrustup\n\n\nAs we will be working with the Rust language, we need to install the rustup toolchain manager. You can follow the instructions from here.\n\n\nPicotool and OpenOCD\n\n\n\nBoth of them can be installed from pico-sdk-tools/releases.\n\n\nFor OpenOCD, we have to set the following environment variable:\nOPENOCD_SCRIPTS: C:\\Users&lt;USER&gt;\\wws\\tools\\openocd\\0.12.0+dev\\scripts\n\n\n\nRISC-V TOOLCHAIN\n\n\n\nInstall pico-sdk-tools/V14\nThis is the version used by Pico SDK in VS Code as of this writing.\n\n\nDo not install pico-sdk-tools/V15, as this didn’t work for me.\nError: Python initialization failed: failed to get the Python codec of the filesystem encoding\n\n\n\nARM TOOLCHAIN\n\n\nInstall arm-gnu-toolchain-14.2.rel1-mingw-w64-x86_64-arm-none-eabi.zip and add it to the PATH environment variable\nWindows (mingw-w64-x86_64) hosted cross toolchains\nAArch32 bare-metal target (arm-none-eabi)\nofficial ARM binaries\n\n\nprobe-rs\n\n\nFollow the installation instructions from the official probe-rs installation page.\n\n\nhumility\n\n\nYou’ll need to install the version from humility/tree/bmatt/update-probe-rs,\nwhich includes an updated probe-rs version that supports our Pico 2W board.\n\n\nFor all the above tools that I have mentioned, you could technically install the latest and greatest tool versions, probably without any issues.\n\n\nhubake\n\n\n\nWe have to install hubake from my forked repo wherein i fixed some of windows specific issues. Follow below steps:\n\n\n\nHubris vs ExHubris\nNow, coming to the actual Hubris kernel, we have 2 repositories to choose from to work on and experiment with. Below is a short comparison between both.\nFeatureHubrisExHubris\nOriginDeveloped by Oxide Computer CompanyCommunity fork/adaptation of Hubris by Cliff Biffle\nPhilosophyDesigned for deeply-embedded systemswith Oxide as the primary goalMaking Hubris accessible to external applications outside the main Hubris repo\nTarget32-bit microcontrollersArchitecture-neutral design(32-bit focus, 64-bit aspirational)\nLanguageRust with nightly toolchainrequirementRust with stable toolchainrequirement\nCurrent StatusMature for ARM Cortex-M,experimental RISC-V support“Hacked-up sprint code” experimental and in flux\n\n\nI chose ExHubris because it’s simple, has less lines of code to study, is easy to understand with the new build system, and there are blog posts by Cliff Biffle that\nexplain the design decisions and architecture in complete detail.\n\nExHubris\nIf you want more info about the design decisions, you could refer to the ExHubris README file along\nwith the Hubris blogs.\napp.kdl\nI have followed the exhubris-demo repository to set up the demo.\nYou can find my repository here: exhubris-demo-rp235x to follow along.\nThe first thing we have to do is write the app.kdl file explaining where to get all our tasks and kernel to form our application.\nThe most important thing here is that we will need a kernel for sure, along with at least 2 tasks: supervisor and idle tasks.\n\n\nSupervisor task: This is needed for managing the overall system and ensuring that all tasks are running smoothly by restarting faulted tasks. This task depends on the application we are targeting.\n\n\nIdle task: This is needed for handling the case when no other tasks are ready to run, so that we can just infinitely loop and\nbe in low power processor mode until any of the other tasks are ready to run.\n\n\nI’m pulling in the above tasks and the kernel from my ExHubris repo as follows:\n\n\n\nHere, I’m actually pointing to my forked repo because I have made some changes to make the build/tool system work on Windows OS.\n\n\nYou can find the details about the same in my PR submitted to the ExHubris repo: [windows] fix build tool issues #6\n\n\nNow coming to my new blinky task which I have written specifically to blink an external LED connected to GPIO22\ninstead of blinking the onboard LED, which is hard to toggle specifically on the Pico 2W board because it is connected to the wireless chip instead of normal GPIO pins.\nThis is not the case for the Pico 2 board which doesn’t have a wireless chip in it.\nBlinky task definition\n\nchip.kdl\nIn chip.kdl, we have to define memory properties such as RAM and flash sizes and also define certain memory regions like io, sio\nand pads regions which we would use for our tasks to explicitly specify that we are allowed to access these memory regions from our task.\n\n\nYou can see in the app.kdl file that we have used the resets peripheral in the kernel and also given access to io, pads and sio peripherals for the blinky task.\n\nBuilding and Flashing\nNow, I will talk about how we could compile and build the firmware and flash it onto the Pico 2W board.\n\n\nBuild the application using hubake\n\n\n\nFlash using either humility or OpenOCD\n\n\nhumility\n\n\nYou need to run explicitly after flashing via humility, bootram boots into our kernel firmware automatically.\n\n\n\nOpenOCD\n\n\nYou have to explicitly run GDB after flashing via OpenOCD, and enter continue to start the application.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\nAfter flashing, you will see output like below –&gt;\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\nKernel panic\nI would like to talk about one instance where I flashed software and the kernel wasn’t booting into the application correctly.\nError details are as follows:\n❯ humility -a .\\cortex-m33-build.zip registers -s\n\nLooking closely, we can see the error is from this code line:\n\nThe flashed software which encountered this error had 544 bytes of stack size for the kernel.\nWith many back-and-forth changes and talking to ChatGPT and Claude, I figured out that the issue was because of a stack overflow.\nAfter changing the stack size for the kernel to 1024 bytes, there was no panic from the kernel.\nI don’t clearly understand yet how to identify this stack overflow corruption by looking at the above log, but according to the documentation,\nwe may no longer need to worry about stack size for the kernel because it will be somehow deduced during compile time.\nI heard this is a feature that will be implemented in future versions of the Hubris kernel.\nNotes\n\n\nIf you’d like to see the Hubris variant of the same app (also working), I’ve published it here: hubris-riscv-hazard3/tree/cortex-m33. This is based on @thenewwazoo’s excellent work in hubris/tree/bmatt/rp2350, with my blinky task added alongside his idle and jefe tasks.\n\n\nAs mentioned, my final goal is to get this same demo running on the Hazard3 RISC-V core. I’ve been experimenting with both the Hubris and ExHubris repos for this porting effort—each has its pros and cons—but since I now have a working demo on both, I’m leaning towards ExHubris because of its simpler build system.\n\n\nFor those curious, my current (non-working, hacky) RISC-V attempts are here:\n\nhubris-riscv-hazard3/tree/riscv\nexhubris-riscv-hazard3/tree/riscv\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nRP2350 Datasheet\nCliffle’s Hubris Blog posts\nHubris Reference\nexhubris-demo-rp235x\nHubris-fork\nexhubris-fork\n\n","description":"","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/hubris-on-pico2/","path":"/blog/hubris-on-pico2/","title":"Hubris OS on RP Pico 2(W) board (Cortex-M33 ARM core)"},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/insta-inspect/":{"body":"Context\nI’ve always had the urge to find out people who had unfollowed me from instagram abruptly.\nHowever, instagram doesn’t provide notifications or an easy way to access this info.\nAs of my knowledge on May 13, 2024, we still have to manually check each and every person from our followers list in our followees list to figure this out.\nIt’s boring and tedious task.\nProblem\nAs a fun exercise, I thought of writing a small python script to figure this out.

This has been ever confusing topic for me whenever i come across such keywords in real world code. This is my understanding and explanation as to when/how to use such keywords and how to reason about the same.\nBasic Exploration\nFirstly, i will define the terms “Lifetime” and “Visibility” as follows:\n\nLifetime: Every object has start and end point beyond which we can’t/shouldn’t access it. In other words it refers to Storage duration of an object.\n\n\nVisibility: An object can/should be accessed from inside block or inside file or from other translation units [.c source files] only according to its visibility. In other words it refers to Linkage of an object.\n\nI will thoroughly explain the concepts with each keywords along the lines of above definition.\nstatic\nLifetime: Changes the lifetime to Static storage duration meaning it will be stored in memory till the end of the program.\nThis applies even for the object’s which are in file scope (local) and/or block scope (global).\nVisibility: Set’s the objects to Internal linkage, i.e, object is accessible only within current translation unit.\n\n\nUn-initialized static objects will be automatically initialized to 0.\n\n\nstatic local variables will be initialized only once and retains its value between function calls.\n\n\nSnippet 1:\n\nSnippet 1 stdout:\n\n\nIn this example, the count variable is declared as static inside the func function.

This demonstrates external linkage, allowing the variable to be accessed across different translation units.\n\nAdvanced Exploration\nScenario 1: Let’s say we have to create user defined type and the object with this type has to be shared among different source files.\n\nUser defined type has to be defined inside an h file and the object should be defined with extern keyword.\nextern will make sure the object is accessible among all source files which includes this header file.\ntype information will also be available in the same source file because of inclusion of this header file.\n\nSnippet 3:\nFile: types.h\n\nFile: main.c\n\nFile: user.c\n\nSnippet 3 stdout:\n\n\nIn this example, the User type is defined in a header file types.h, and the user variable is declared as extern. The variable is defined in user.c and accessed in main.c, demonstrating external linkage and sharing of user-defined types across different source files.\n\nScenario 2: Let’s say we have to create a user-defined function that should be encapsulated and shouldn’t be shared with other source files.\n\nIf we define a function in a header (.h) file and include it in multiple source files, it can be used in all those source files because, by default, all functions have extern linkage unless explicitly changed.\nTo limit the visibility of a function to the current source file, we use the static keyword.

These constants are part of every functional unit within the entire ECU software. Most software development for ECUs is done using tools like ASCET and sometimes Matlab/Simulink, depending on the team and the specific functional unit.\nBoth ASCET and Matlab/Simulink are model-based code generators. Instead of writing code manually, developers create flow diagrams by dragging and dropping basic and user-defined classes/blocks. These diagrams represent the required functionality of an ECU sub-system, and the tools generate the corresponding C code.\nEach sub-system (functional unit) has its own set of variant coding constants, which enable or disable features based on the customer’s requirements. ASCET has a built-in tool called model_reducer. This tool uses a global CSV file (variant_coding.csv) containing all the variant coding constants for the entire ECU software. By referencing this CSV file, ASCET can generate a reduced version of the model to enable or disable specific feature blocks.\nProblem\nIn Matlab/Simulink, we need to manually update each variant coding value within the Simulink data dictionary (sldd) file based on the global CSV file. This manual process is error-prone and time-consuming for developers. To address this, we can automate the task using a script.\nSolution\nOur script should take two input files: the variant_coding.csv file and the model.sldd file.

I currently have access to Pico 2 w Board for development and testing.\nHubris is a real time operating system designed for embedded devices and it has a very unique trait wherein that hardware that it runs on should have Physical memory protection unit,\nnot necessarily Memory management unit and each and every task the OS spawns must be allocated its own memory region and memory protected. This trait helps in isolating tasks and preventing them from interfering with each other’s memory. So theoretically speaking, we could compile different tasks seperately and link them together to form a complete system image.\nThis direction has already been prototyped by exhubris. I have successfully implemented idle and supervisor tasks which are absolutely necessary for an Hubris built application. But for me to actually get a visual feedback that this final image works, I need to implement a blinky task that will toggle the LED on and off.\nFor more information checkout my ongoing prototype in forked repo’s Hubris and exhubris.\nThere’s actually a blocker as to use HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) in this context. Since Hubris requires strict memory protection and isolation between tasks, using a traditional HAL could lead to potential violations of these principles. For this reason, Hubris pre-built application demos actually use PAC (Peripheral Access Crate) to interact with hardware in a way that is compatible with its memory protection model. You can checkout this issue for additional context.\nI have researched online about using rp235x-pac crate to control the GPIO pins on the Pico 2 W board and toggle the LED. But i didn’t find any examples or documentation specifically addressing this use case. And more importantly i could not use inbuilt LED to blink as is connected to wifi chip present in pico 2 w board, this is not the case in pico 2 board.\nHence, I’m toggling an external LED connected to one of the GPIO pins.\nProblem Statement\nTo blink an LED connected to one of the GPIO pins on Pico 2 (w) board. We are not allowed to use HAL crate, so we need to use PAC directly to manipulate the GPIO registers.\nImplementation Details\nI tried to use RP2350 Datasheet and rp235x-pac to implement on my own and found out that it’s pretty hard. Hence i went down the path of reverse engineering the HAL crate and how it interacts with the PAC to control the GPIO pins. This implementation is basically my reverse-engineered version of the HAL crate, tailored to work within the constraints of Hubris OS.\nFrom this point onward you could forget everything about Hubris OS and only concentrate on how to use rp235x-pac crate to control the GPIO pins. Because the underlying principles of using PAC for direct hardware access remain the same regardless of the OS constraints.\nImage Metadata\nAs per RP2350 Datasheet Section:5.9.5. Minimum Viable Image Metadata\n\nAs per the datasheet, we know we have to create the following Image Metadata for riscv cores –&gt;\n\n\n\nlink_section = “.start_block” is used to place the IMAGE_DEF block in a specific section of the binary, ensuring it is located within the first 4 kB of a flash image.\n\nGPIO Setup\nTo setup GPIO on rp235x, we need access to 3 peripherals: SIO, IO_BANK0, and PADS_BANK0.\n\nSIO: Single-cycle I/O for fast GPIO operations\nIO_BANK0: GPIO function selection and control\nPADS_BANK0: Electrical characteristics and pad isolation\n\nGet an instance of this peripherals by using the rp235x-pac crate.\n\nNow for example we could consider any GPIO pin to connect external LED for testing, i used GPIO22.\nwe need to setup this pin as OUTPUT.\n\nAnd then we need to configure the PADS such that input enable on, output disable is off and remove pad isolation to attach a function to this GPIO.\n\nAnd then we set the GPIO function to SIO (Single-cycle IO subsystem) using which we write to the GPIO.\n\nFinally we could use the SIO to toggle the LED state.\n\nThis is the minimum code that is required to control GPIO by using the PAC instead of depending on the HAL.\nRunning on Pico 2(w) board\nTo run the code, you could checkout my rp-hal crate and run the blinky example as follows –&gt;\n\n\ncargo rrr-blinky will compile and flash the code successfully and run the code using picotool. Be sure to checkout the documentation on how to set-up the required tools to flash and run.\n\nConclusion\n\n\nFull script is available on github rp-hal-blinky\n\n\nIf you are looking for hubris task which is almost similar to the rp-hal example, you could checkout the same in exhubris-blinky\n\n\nIf you are interested in exploring the exact differences as to which PAC code compares to HAL code, you could look into the\ngithub-commit\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nRP2350 Datasheet\n\n\nCliffle’s Hubris Blog posts\n\n\nHubris Reference\n\n\nHubris-fork\n\n\nexhubris-fork\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/rp235x-blinky/","path":"/blog/rp235x-blinky/","title":"Blink an LED using rp235x-pac crate"},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/swap-numbers/":{"body":"Motivation\nI was thinking about famous C interview question wherein we will be asked to swap 2 variables. Generally, this could be solved using pointers with either using temporary variable or with xor method.\nBut now i want to tackle the same problem in a different perspective.\nInstead of changing the variable’s values, what if we were asked to swap its addresses instead of values ?\nSolving this problem was not straight forward as i thought initially, it involves some fair bit of understanding pointers and pointer to pointer (int** for example) manipulations.\nIn this blog, i will try to explain how i got to the solution or in other words, how i would solve it.\nExploration\nFirst, lets see how we would solve the problem of swapping 2 variables using function swap. We would write a function as follows, which uses temporary variable as a placeholder to exchange numbers.\nSnippet 1:\n\nSnippet 1 stdout:\n\nSurprisingly, we would see the variables are swapped but it is not reflected back to the caller in the main function.\n\nIn C, each and every function has its own stack which will be created at the time of function call and destroyed after function call exits. Another most important part is, function parameters and each variables created inside the function is stored in its own stack.\n\nHence, even though swap() is changing a and b, it is changing only inside its own stack (look @FUNC output above) and these local variables will be destroyed once function call exits. Hence @AFTER output is unchanged.\n\nIn C, to change values present in one function from another function, we have a classic tool for that which is pointers. You would have to share the address of variables (“value of interest”) to the function, to access and change the values present inside.\n\nSnippet 2:\n\nSnippet 2 stdout:\n\nWe are sharing a and b by sending its addresses (&amp;a, &amp;b) to swap func.\nInside swap func, we are dereferencing a and b (*ap, *bp) to get inside its values and swapping them, this way we are modifying the memory of a and b stored inside main func stack. Output reflects the same above. Here value of interest is a and b and we sent its addresses for modification. This is the most important part of pointers. PLease remember this, this will come back when we try to swap 2 pointers instead of values.\nNow that we know how to swap 2 variables using pointers to the variables, let’s look at the problem of swapping pointers itself (i.e, addresses of variables).\nFirst we will try the naive way as we did in snippet 1.\nSnippet 3:\n\nSnippet 3 stdout:\n\n\nNOTE: Output addresses printed in the stdout changes with every fresh run of the program and concentrate only on the addresses for now.\n\nSame fate as Snippet 1 output, we were able to change the addresses but it only reflects inside swap func not in main func. The problem again is, we are changing the addresses local to swap function. To change the addresses present in main function, we have to send pointers to these addresses, because now our value of interest is (&amp;a, &amp;b).\nLet’s try sending the pointers to addresses of a and b –&gt;\nSnippet 4:\n\nSnippet 4 stdout:\n\nWe passed pointers to value of interest and dereferenced inside the calling function to change the values inside it directly so that it reflects back in the caller site.\nAstute reader may have noticed,\nwe were able to swap the addresses but not the values of a and b.\nCan you decode why ???\n\nThis question is left as an exercise for the reader and modify the snippet so that we were able to change both addresses and values of variables a and b.\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThere is one most important takeaway from this post which i would like to highlight. If you want to modify values (“value of interest”) present in one function from another function, you should share pointers to those “value of interest”.\n\n\nFull script is available on github swap_numbers.c\n\n\nReference: cslibrary.stanford.edu/102\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/swap-numbers/","path":"/blog/swap-numbers/","title":"Swapping addresses instead of values"},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/bookmarks/":{"body":"📕 Noteworthy Blogs\n\nfasterthanli.me\nEmbedded in Academia – John Regehr\nNull Program\nSoftwareCarpentry\nWalking Randomly\nAgner Fog\nRalf’s Ramblings\nBartosz Ciechanowski\nthephd.dev\nBeej’s Guides\nduramecho\nDmitry.GR\nEric S.

This is a perfect video that I found to learn this stuff and I know I/Someone else will refer to this often and find it useful.\nWays to Obtain Software\nDownloading Upstream Binary Distributions\nBinaries will be available directly, which we can download and run without building software from scratch. These are built by the project maintainers for all major distributions.\nExample: On GitHub, this will mostly be available under the Releases page of the repo.\nDownloading from System Package Managers\nBinaries can be downloaded by particular system package managers. These will be built by package maintainers and not necessarily by the project maintainers.\nExample:\n\nchoco, scoop, winget for Windows\napt-get, apt for Linux Debian\nbrew for macOS\n\nBuilding Directly from Source\nCreating binaries from source is the best way to do it if we want to change the source code and behavior of some specifics and also if we want to configure differently than what upstream/system packages do.\nMost of the core software is built in C/C++. Typically, there will be 3 phases to install such software: configure, build, and install.\n\n\nConfigure:\n\nDuring this phase, we can configure different kinds of things, including but not limited to enabling/disabling features.\nThe most important configuration is to choose a non-root folder as the prefix to install the software. This is important because we don’t want to mess up the system files. And we can install software without using sudo.\n\n\n\nBuild:\n\nThis is the phase where the software is actually built.\nmake is used to achieve this. But make has terrible defaults. So, we need to pass some flags to make it work as we want.\n\nExample: Enable parallel build using the -j &lt;N&gt; flag. Make sure to pass in the number of cores to use, or else it will keep on forking new processes, and there is a high chance that the system will hang.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall:\n\nmake install is used to achieve this. This will install the software in the prefix location, which is $prefix/bin.\nWe can avoid using sudo make install because we would have configured the software to install in a non-root folder.\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nDo not use the dev branch where stuff could break; instead, use the latest bugfix release tagged branch to build software from source.\nDo not use a different compiler toolchain; always try to stick to your system toolchain.\nTry installing software without actually using docker or a virtual machine, because it’s easier that way.\nDo not ssh into a different machine to copy files haphazardly.\nDo not use weird configure options to build the software.\nDo not edit the source haphazardly to make it work most of the time.\n\nReferences\n\nHow to Build Software From Source - Andrew Kelley\n\n","description":"","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/building-software-from-source/","path":"/til/building-software-from-source/","title":"Building Software from Source"},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/case-sensitive-windows/":{"body":"\n\nI was trying to clone the Linux git stable repository on my Windows 10 machine using the following command:\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this failed with the following warning because the Linux tree contains files with the same name but with different case sensitivity:\n\n\n\nThe Windows 10 file system by default is case-insensitive, meaning it treats both ip6t_hl.h and ip6t_HL.h as the same file.
