This has been ever confusing topic for me whenever i come across such keywords in real world code. This is my understanding and explanation as to when/how to use such keywords and how to reason about the same.\nBasic Exploration\nFirstly, i will define the terms “Lifetime” and “Visibility” as follows:\n\nLifetime: Every object has start and end point beyond which we can’t/shouldn’t access it. In other words it refers to Storage duration of an object.\n\n\nVisibility: An object can/should be accessed from inside block or inside file or from other translation units [.c source files] only according to its visibility. In other words it refers to Linkage of an object.\n\nI will thoroughly explain the concepts with each keywords along the lines of above definition.\nstatic\nLifetime: Changes the lifetime to Static storage duration meaning it will be stored in memory till the end of the program.\nThis applies even for the object’s which are in file scope (local) and/or block scope (global).\nVisibility: Set’s the objects to Internal linkage, i.e, object is accessible only within current translation unit.\n\n\nUn-initialized static objects will be automatically initialized to 0.\n\n\nstatic local variables will be initialized only once and retains its value between function calls.\n\n\nSnippet 1:\n\nSnippet 1 stdout:\n\n\nIn this example, the count variable is declared as static inside the func function. It retains its value between function calls, demonstrating static storage duration and internal linkage.\n\nextern\nLifetime: Changes the lifetime to Static storage duration meaning it will be stored in memory till the end of the program.\nThis applies even for the object’s which are in file scope (local) and/or block scope (global).\nVisibility: Set’s the objects to External linkage, i.e, object is accessible to other current translation units.\n\nBy default all functions and global variables will be set to extern unless otherwise overwritten.\n\nSnippet 2:\nFile: main.c\n\nFile: global.c\n\nSnippet 2 stdout:\n\n\nIn this example, globalVar is declared as extern in main.c and defined in global.c. This demonstrates external linkage, allowing the variable to be accessed across different translation units.\n\nAdvanced Exploration\nScenario 1: Let’s say we have to create user defined type and the object with this type has to be shared among different source files.\n\nUser defined type has to be defined inside an h file and the object should be defined with extern keyword.\nextern will make sure the object is accessible among all source files which includes this header file.\ntype information will also be available in the same source file because of inclusion of this header file.\n\nSnippet 3:\nFile: types.h\n\nFile: main.c\n\nFile: user.c\n\nSnippet 3 stdout:\n\n\nIn this example, the User type is defined in a header file types.h, and the user variable is declared as extern. The variable is defined in user.c and accessed in main.c, demonstrating external linkage and sharing of user-defined types across different source files.\n\nScenario 2: Let’s say we have to create a user-defined function that should be encapsulated and shouldn’t be shared with other source files.\n\nIf we define a function in a header (.h) file and include it in multiple source files, it can be used in all those source files because, by default, all functions have extern linkage unless explicitly changed.\nTo limit the visibility of a function to the current source file, we use the static keyword. This ensures the function can only be used within that single file. It is important to define the function in a .c file, not in a .h file, so that when the .h file is included in multiple source files, the function remains inaccessible.\n\nSnippet 4:\nFile: utils.c\n\nFile: utils.h\n\nFile: main.c\n\n\nIn this example, helperFunction is defined as static in utils.c, limiting its visibility to that file. publicFunction can call helperFunction within utils.c, but helperFunction is not accessible in main.c, demonstrating the use of static to encapsulate functions within a single source file.\n\nSummary\nKeywordLifetimeVisibility\nstaticStored till program endsAccessible only within current file\nexternStored till program endsAccessible across different files\n\n","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/lifetime-visibility-in-c/","title":"Lifetime and Visibility in C Programs"},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/matlab-reducer/":{"body":"Context\nIn automotive engine control unit (ECU) software, we use global constants called variant coding constants to enable or disable specific features. These constants are part of every functional unit within the entire ECU software. Most software development for ECUs is done using tools like ASCET and sometimes Matlab/Simulink, depending on the team and the specific functional unit.\nBoth ASCET and Matlab/Simulink are model-based code generators. Instead of writing code manually, developers create flow diagrams by dragging and dropping basic and user-defined classes/blocks. These diagrams represent the required functionality of an ECU sub-system, and the tools generate the corresponding C code.\nEach sub-system (functional unit) has its own set of variant coding constants, which enable or disable features based on the customer’s requirements. ASCET has a built-in tool called model_reducer. This tool uses a global CSV file (variant_coding.csv) containing all the variant coding constants for the entire ECU software. By referencing this CSV file, ASCET can generate a reduced version of the model to enable or disable specific feature blocks.\nProblem\nIn Matlab/Simulink, we need to manually update each variant coding value within the Simulink data dictionary (sldd) file based on the global CSV file. This manual process is error-prone and time-consuming for developers. To address this, we can automate the task using a script.\nSolution\nOur script should take two input files: the variant_coding.csv file and the model.sldd file. It should then output a modified model_modified.sldd file and an updated variant_coding_modified.csv file.\nHere’s a high-level overview of how to write this script in Matlab.\nThis function takes the input CSV and sldd files and generates the required modified files.\n\nIn the following sections, I will explain the individual components needed to achieve this outcome.\ncsv2dict will read the csv file and stores the values along with names in a dictionary.\n\nmodify_sldd function will modify the values present in the sldd file with values we read from csv file.\nWe read the Design Data section from sldd file and then we export the values to a .mat file which is\nnecessary to modify the values. we just search all the VCs in dictionary and grad the values and rewrite with updated values and save to a\nnew .mat file. THis file is then used to update and save the modified sldd file.\n\nwrite_csv function will just create a new csv with old and new values for all variant coding constants present in the model.\n\nConclusion\n\n\nFull script is available on github matlab_reducer.m\n\n\nThanks to my friend Vijeth Angadi for reviewing the draft version of this blog.\n\n\n","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/matlab-reducer/","title":"Matlab/Simulink Model Reducer"},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/rp235x-blinky/":{"body":"Motivation\nI have been experimenting with Hubris OS to port to riscv ISA. I currently have access to Pico 2 w Board for development and testing.\nHubris is a real time operating system designed for embedded devices and it has a very unique trait wherein that hardware that it runs on should have Physical memory protection unit,\nnot necessarily Memory management unit and each and every task the OS spawns must be allocated its own memory region and memory protected. This trait helps in isolating tasks and preventing them from interfering with each other’s memory. So theoretically speaking, we could compile different tasks seperately and link them together to form a complete system image.\nThis direction has already been prototyped by exhubris. I have successfully implemented idle and supervisor tasks which are absolutely necessary for an Hubris built application. But for me to actually get a visual feedback that this final image works, I need to implement a blinky task that will toggle the LED on and off.\nFor more information checkout my ongoing prototype in forked repo’s Hubris and exhubris.\nThere’s actually a blocker as to use HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) in this context. Since Hubris requires strict memory protection and isolation between tasks, using a traditional HAL could lead to potential violations of these principles. For this reason, Hubris pre-built application demos actually use PAC (Peripheral Access Crate) to interact with hardware in a way that is compatible with its memory protection model. You can checkout this issue for additional context.\nI have researched online about using rp235x-pac crate to control the GPIO pins on the Pico 2 W board and toggle the LED. But i didn’t find any examples or documentation specifically addressing this use case. And more importantly i could not use inbuilt LED to blink as is connected to wifi chip present in pico 2 w board, this is not the case in pico 2 board.\nHence, I’m toggling an external LED connected to one of the GPIO pins.\nProblem Statement\nTo blink an LED connected to one of the GPIO pins on Pico 2 (w) board. We are not allowed to use HAL crate, so we need to use PAC directly to manipulate the GPIO registers.\nImplementation Details\nI tried to use RP2350 Datasheet and rp235x-pac to implement on my own and found out that it’s pretty hard. Hence i went down the path of reverse engineering the HAL crate and how it interacts with the PAC to control the GPIO pins. This implementation is basically my reverse-engineered version of the HAL crate, tailored to work within the constraints of Hubris OS.\nFrom this point onward you could forget everything about Hubris OS and only concentrate on how to use rp235x-pac crate to control the GPIO pins. Because the underlying principles of using PAC for direct hardware access remain the same regardless of the OS constraints.\nImage Metadata\nAs per RP2350 Datasheet Section:5.9.5. Minimum Viable Image Metadata\n\nAs per the datasheet, we know we have to create the following Image Metadata for riscv cores –&gt;\n\n\n\nlink_section = “.start_block” is used to place the IMAGE_DEF block in a specific section of the binary, ensuring it is located within the first 4 kB of a flash image.\n\nGPIO Setup\nTo setup GPIO on rp235x, we need access to 3 peripherals: SIO, IO_BANK0, and PADS_BANK0.\n\nSIO: Single-cycle I/O for fast GPIO operations\nIO_BANK0: GPIO function selection and control\nPADS_BANK0: Electrical characteristics and pad isolation\n\nGet an instance of this peripherals by using the rp235x-pac crate.\n\nNow for example we could consider any GPIO pin to connect external LED for testing, i used GPIO22.\nwe need to setup this pin as OUTPUT.\n\nAnd then we need to configure the PADS such that input enable on, output disable is off and remove pad isolation to attach a function to this GPIO.\n\nAnd then we set the GPIO function to SIO (Single-cycle IO subsystem) using which we write to the GPIO.\n\nFinally we could use the SIO to toggle the LED state.\n\nThis is the minimum code that is required to control GPIO by using the PAC instead of depending on the HAL.\nRunning on Pico 2(w) board\nTo run the code, you could checkout my rp-hal crate and run the blinky example as follows –&gt;\n\n\ncargo rrr-blinky will compile and flash the code successfully and run the code using picotool. Be sure to checkout the documentation on how to set-up the required tools to flash and run.\n\nConclusion\n\n\nFull script is available on github rp-hal-blinky\n\n\nIf you are looking for hubris task which is almost similar to the rp-hal example, you could checkout the same in exhubris-blinky\n\n\nIf you are interested in exploring the exact differences as to which PAC code compares to HAL code, you could look into the\ngithub-commit\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nRP2350 Datasheet\n\n\nCliffle’s Hubris Blog posts\n\n\nHubris Reference\n\n\nHubris-fork\n\n\nexhubris-fork\n\n\n","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/rp235x-blinky/","title":"Blink an LED using rp235x-pac crate"},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/swap-numbers/":{"body":"Motivation\nI was thinking about famous C interview question wherein we will be asked to swap 2 variables. Generally, this could be solved using pointers with either using temporary variable or with xor method.\nBut now i want to tackle the same problem in a different perspective.\nInstead of changing the variable’s values, what if we were asked to swap its addresses instead of values ?\nSolving this problem was not straight forward as i thought initially, it involves some fair bit of understanding pointers and pointer to pointer (int** for example) manipulations.\nIn this blog, i will try to explain how i got to the solution or in other words, how i would solve it.\nExploration\nFirst, lets see how we would solve the problem of swapping 2 variables using function swap. We would write a function as follows, which uses temporary variable as a placeholder to exchange numbers.\nSnippet 1:\n\nSnippet 1 stdout:\n\nSurprisingly, we would see the variables are swapped but it is not reflected back to the caller in the main function.\n\nIn C, each and every function has its own stack which will be created at the time of function call and destroyed after function call exits. Another most important part is, function parameters and each variables created inside the function is stored in its own stack.\n\nHence, even though swap() is changing a and b, it is changing only inside its own stack (look @FUNC output above) and these local variables will be destroyed once function call exits. Hence @AFTER output is unchanged.\n\nIn C, to change values present in one function from another function, we have a classic tool for that which is pointers. You would have to share the address of variables (“value of interest”) to the function, to access and change the values present inside.\n\nSnippet 2:\n\nSnippet 2 stdout:\n\nWe are sharing a and b by sending its addresses (&amp;a, &amp;b) to swap func.\nInside swap func, we are dereferencing a and b (*ap, *bp) to get inside its values and swapping them, this way we are modifying the memory of a and b stored inside main func stack. Output reflects the same above. Here value of interest is a and b and we sent its addresses for modification. This is the most important part of pointers. PLease remember this, this will come back when we try to swap 2 pointers instead of values.\nNow that we know how to swap 2 variables using pointers to the variables, let’s look at the problem of swapping pointers itself (i.e, addresses of variables).\nFirst we will try the naive way as we did in snippet 1.\nSnippet 3:\n\nSnippet 3 stdout:\n\n\nNOTE: Output addresses printed in the stdout changes with every fresh run of the program and concentrate only on the addresses for now.\n\nSame fate as Snippet 1 output, we were able to change the addresses but it only reflects inside swap func not in main func. The problem again is, we are changing the addresses local to swap function. To change the addresses present in main function, we have to send pointers to these addresses, because now our value of interest is (&amp;a, &amp;b).\nLet’s try sending the pointers to addresses of a and b –&gt;\nSnippet 4:\n\nSnippet 4 stdout:\n\nWe passed pointers to value of interest and dereferenced inside the calling function to change the values inside it directly so that it reflects back in the caller site.\nAstute reader may have noticed,\nwe were able to swap the addresses but not the values of a and b.\nCan you decode why ???\n\nThis question is left as an exercise for the reader and modify the snippet so that we were able to change both addresses and values of variables a and b.\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThere is one most important takeaway from this post which i would like to highlight. If you want to modify values (“value of interest”) present in one function from another function, you should share pointers to those “value of interest”.\n\n\nFull script is available on github swap_numbers.c\n\n\nReference: cslibrary.stanford.edu/102\n\n\n","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/swap-numbers/","title":"Swapping addresses instead of values"},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/bookmarks/":{"body":"📕 Noteworthy Blogs\n\nfasterthanli.me\nEmbedded in Academia – John Regehr\nNull Program\nSoftwareCarpentry\nWalking Randomly\nAgner Fog\nRalf’s Ramblings\nBartosz Ciechanowski\nthephd.dev\nBeej’s Guides\nduramecho\nDmitry.GR\nEric S.

This is a perfect video that I found to learn this stuff and I know I/Someone else will refer to this often and find it useful.\nWays to Obtain Software\nDownloading Upstream Binary Distributions\nBinaries will be available directly, which we can download and run without building software from scratch. These are built by the project maintainers for all major distributions.\nExample: On GitHub, this will mostly be available under the Releases page of the repo.\nDownloading from System Package Managers\nBinaries can be downloaded by particular system package managers. These will be built by package maintainers and not necessarily by the project maintainers.\nExample:\n\nchoco, scoop, winget for Windows\napt-get, apt for Linux Debian\nbrew for macOS\n\nBuilding Directly from Source\nCreating binaries from source is the best way to do it if we want to change the source code and behavior of some specifics and also if we want to configure differently than what upstream/system packages do.\nMost of the core software is built in C/C++. Typically, there will be 3 phases to install such software: configure, build, and install.\n\n\nConfigure:\n\nDuring this phase, we can configure different kinds of things, including but not limited to enabling/disabling features.\nThe most important configuration is to choose a non-root folder as the prefix to install the software. This is important because we don’t want to mess up the system files. And we can install software without using sudo.\n\n\n\nBuild:\n\nThis is the phase where the software is actually built.\nmake is used to achieve this. But make has terrible defaults. So, we need to pass some flags to make it work as we want.\n\nExample: Enable parallel build using the -j &lt;N&gt; flag. Make sure to pass in the number of cores to use, or else it will keep on forking new processes, and there is a high chance that the system will hang.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall:\n\nmake install is used to achieve this. This will install the software in the prefix location, which is $prefix/bin.\nWe can avoid using sudo make install because we would have configured the software to install in a non-root folder.\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nDo not use the dev branch where stuff could break; instead, use the latest bugfix release tagged branch to build software from source.\nDo not use a different compiler toolchain; always try to stick to your system toolchain.\nTry installing software without actually using docker or a virtual machine, because it’s easier that way.\nDo not ssh into a different machine to copy files haphazardly.\nDo not use weird configure options to build the software.\nDo not edit the source haphazardly to make it work most of the time.\n\nReferences\n\nHow to Build Software From Source - Andrew Kelley\n\n","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/building-software-from-source/","title":"Building Software from Source"},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/case-sensitive-windows/":{"body":"\n\nI was trying to clone the Linux git stable repository on my Windows 10 machine using the following command:\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this failed with the following warning because the Linux tree contains files with the same name but with different case sensitivity:\n\n\n\nThe Windows 10 file system by default is case-insensitive, meaning it treats both ip6t_hl.h and ip6t_HL.h as the same file.

The included file can be any file with any extension (e.g., *.c, *.h, *.cpp) as long as it contains C source code that the compiler can understand.\nIn the end, all object files generated for each TU will be linked by the linker to produce an executable.\n\nExample\nSnippet 1:\nFile: print.exe\n\nFile: main.c\n\nCompile:\n\nSnippet 1 stdout:\n\n\nIn this example, we have one TU i.e, main.c which includes other source file print.exe, even though the extension is *.exe it still works as expected.\nOutput prints both the print statements from main.c and print.exe file.\n\nReferences\n\nHandmade Hero Chat 013 - Translation Units, Function Pointers, Compilation, Linking, and Execution\n\n","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/translation-unit/","title":"Translation Unit in C"},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/x64-vs-amd64/":{"body":"\nOn GitHub, when I download binaries for my WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), I found that people use x86_64 and amd64 interchangeably to refer to the same thing, which is a processor that implements the 64-bit version of the x86 (32-bit ISA).\nThere are many 32-bit and 64-bit Instruction Set Architectures (ISA) available, which are implemented by processors.\nx86 is the 32-bit ISA, whereas x86_64 is the general name used by most people to refer to the 64-bit version of x86.\nHowever, AMD was the company that released the 64-bit version of x86, and they named it amd64.\nThere are many historical reasons for using two different names, x86_64 and amd64, to refer to the same 64-bit ISA of x86 (32-bit ISA), but the important thing to remember is that both refers to same thing.\n\nReferences\n\nStack Overflow: x86_64 vs amd64\n\n","id":"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/x64-vs-amd64/","title":"x64 vs amd64"}},"docInfo":{"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/":{"body":33,"title":1},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/copy-binaries/":{"body":160,"title":4},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/insta-inspect/":{"body":144,"title":3},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/lifetime-visibility-in-c/":{"body":418,"title":4},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/matlab-reducer/":{"body":271,"title":3},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/rp235x-blinky/":{"body":495,"title":6},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/blog/swap-numbers/":{"body":367,"title":4},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/bookmarks/":{"body":197,"title":1},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/cv/":{"body":6,"title":1},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/projects/":{"body":223,"title":1},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/asciinema-windows/":{"body":96,"title":3},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/building-software-from-source/":{"body":263,"title":3},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/case-sensitive-windows/":{"body":80,"title":4},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/local-commits-to-forked-feature-branch/":{"body":149,"title":5},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/translation-unit/":{"body":90,"title":3},"https://Karthik-d-k.github.io/til/x64-vs-amd64/":{"body":92,"title":3}},"length":18},"lang":"English"}
